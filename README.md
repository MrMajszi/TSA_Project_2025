# TSA Project 2025

FORECASTING FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS PRICES WITH VECM AND ARIMA MODELS

Project description:
The aim of the project is to compare accuracy of forecasts of prices of two cointegrated financial
instruments with VECM model and two independent univariate ARIMA models.
In order to accomplish the task you should:
• Download the provided TSA_2025_project_data_1.csv file with time series including prices of ten
financial instruments.
• Find one cointegrated pair out of ten provided time series. There is more than one cointegrated
pair but you are supposed to find just one of them. If you found more than one pair, you can
choose any of them for further analysis.
• Build a bivariate VECM model for the identified pair and produce forecasts of prices of two
instruments for the out-of-sample period.
• Find separately for two instruments the most attractive univariate ARIMA models and produce
forecasts for the same out-of-sample period.
• Compare accuracy of forecasts of the prices using the ex-post forecast error measures.
• Prepare a short report on it.
